This project involves the development of a website for requesting music production services, where clients can request the services of a music producer to create musical arrangements, including beat production, mixing, mastering, and other music-related services. The application was developed solely in Node.js and follows a server-side architecture to handle client requests.

The backend of the application functions as a server using Node.js, providing endpoints for various operations such as adding producers, managing services, and handling client requests for music production. Additionally, an administration section was implemented, allowing administrators to perform operations such as adding producers, managing available services, and overseeing client requests.

The website follows a simple folder structure, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the code according to its concerns, ensuring a clear separation of data, presentation, and user interaction.

Comprehensive documentation has been created for the backend operations, detailing the available endpoints, supported operations, and other relevant information. This documentation aims to facilitate seamless integration and usage of the backend by other developers, providing a clear understanding of the available functionality and endpoints for interaction.

I hope this revised description accurately captures the essence of your Node.js project. If you have any further adjustments or need additional information, feel free to let me know!
